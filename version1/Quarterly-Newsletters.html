									    <p>This page contains the contents of quarterly letters we have written to our clients. Reading through them will give you a good idea what it is like to be with us.</p>

    <p>If you do read them you will notice we just keep on saying the same thing over and over. The key to investment success is behavioral control. Be a long-term investor. Don’t give in to your emotions. Don’t panic buy when the market is rising or panic sell when it is falling. This is our central tenant. Easy to say but amazingly hard to do. The large majority of mutual fund money goes into the Morningstar four or five star funds – the funds that have done well lately. And the result is that fund investors under perform their own funds by fifty percent. Performance chasing, aka market timing, is a disaster. We believe patience is king in investing.</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">This letter is going to be mainly about us and our new reports. However, before we get into that let’s talk about something more important - cosmology. About a month ago a most wondrous discovery was announced. The Harvard-Smithsonian Center for...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The past year has been quite remarkable. U.S. equity returns for the year (the S&amp;P 500) are over 30%. Many market timers, frightened out of equities by the 2008 – 2009 crash, are now being frightened back in. As the market has been rising we have...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">There are two fundamental types of investing, prediction investing and market based risk versus return investing. Prediction investing tries to anticipate macro trends in the world and thus determine what will do well or badly in the markets. Market ba...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As you know, we offer both financial planning and asset management services. In the last few years, with the stock market crash and fragile world economies, our letters have focused on investing, but financial planning is actually the first and most ba...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The election we wrote about in our last letter is over and the fiscal cliff has been at least delayed a bit. The world economy, with the exception of Europe, seems to be doing better. The equity markets have responded with a strong start. And the inves...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The U.S. elections are near and no clear winner is emerging. The outcome will likely affect tax policy and rates, government spending, financial market regulations and the health of Social Security and Medicare. At the same time Iran is apparently cont...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The academic evidence is overwhelming that market timing and stock picking do not work. Why then do investors, professional and amateur, continue to use these methods? Why do individuals look for managers who claim to have beaten the market? Why do the...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">April 4, 2012 – the day on which the great market collapse of this decade finally got back to even. From October 9, 2007 through March 9, 2009 the S&P 500 fell nearly 50%, the worst bear market since 1929. However, as of April 4, the Wilshire 5000, t...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">In 2011, global diversification proved as important as ever. Although diversification may not have prevented losses, investors with broadly diversified portfolios were better equipped to endure the uncertainty. U.S. stocks experienced some of the highe...</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The stock market now feels like it did in 2008 and 2009. It is violently volatile and one has the thought that it could just fall off the edge of the world – go down and then stay down for a very long time. This time the fear factor is, if possible, ...</p>

            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-october-2010/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2010</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The past nineteen months have felt a bit like walking on thin ice. The downward spiral of the economy has been stopped but there is no upward lift. It all seems very fragile.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-july-2010/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2010</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">We are pleased to announce the launch of our website www.pinneyandscofield.com. We believe this tool will be helpful in many ways - and with it we will join the modern world.</p>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-april-2010/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2010</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The remarkable stock market rally continued through the first quarter of 2010, thus bringing your one year returns to between 30-80% depending on your allocation (see your enclosed Twelve Month Asset Class Performance Summary for your exact number).</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-january-2010/">Quarterly Newsletter - January 2010</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">Last year proved to be unusually rewarding for equity investors around the world. Calendar year returns were more than 25% in 41 out of the 45 countries tracked by Morgan Stanley Capital International.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-october-2009/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2009</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The recovery we wrote about in our last letter has continued, with strong returns in both equities and bonds. As such we think this is a great time to start thinking about the down-side.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-july-2009/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2009</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As you are no doubt aware, there has been a very sharp recovery in the equity markets. From March 9th to the end of June the S&P 500 was up over 35%, US small cap stocks were up more than 48%, international stocks were up about 45% and emerging markets were up over 55%. That’s 55%, in a bit more than three months. It’s quite remarkable.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-april-2009/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2009</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">We would like to start out by saying that this letter will not answer the big question – “when will it stop?” It would be comforting to believe that this question is answerable. Perhaps that is why we are susceptible to articulate (or loud) hucksters who claim to know. But deep down we understand that it cannot be known.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-january-2009/">Quarterly Newsletter - January 2009</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">2008 was a disaster in the markets. We are told this over and over – there has never been a year so bad since 1931 – and very likely more disaster lies ahead.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-october-2008/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2008</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">What is going on now in the financial markets is both unprecedented and yet also just the same old stuff. And the same rules apply. There are two types of investors, or two types of investment behavior - pro-cyclical and contra-cyclical.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-july-2008/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2008</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The stock markets of the world continue to fall. We are now officially in a bear market, with both the S&P 500 and the Dow down more than 20% since last October. Some markets are down much more.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-april-2008/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2008</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The markets are looking like a three-year-old after a double shot latte – moving around a lot but not going anywhere! Current prices of the major markets are very similar to the beginning of 2007, but the daily and weekly changes during that time have been some of the most volatile in history.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-january-2008/">Quarterly Newsletter - January 2008</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">We were thinking we might just send the last letter we wrote. Not much has changed. The credit markets are still panicked and the equity markets are scared as well.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-october-2007/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2007</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">We have just been provided with yet another lesson on how difficult it is to time the market. Starting in mid-August the world-wide credit markets had the financial equivalent of a massive stroke.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-july-2007/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2007</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">When markets begin to turn weak, the newspapers are full of stories about why the markets might fall precipitously. The reasons vary. This time it is sub-prime loans.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-april-2007/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2007</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">In our last few letters we have made reference to the recent spectacular performance of the world equity markets.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-january-2007/">Quarterly Newsletter - January 2007</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">So – the end of one year, the beginning of another – and the same old questions. The markets have done remarkably well over the past year.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-october-2006/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2006</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As you may have heard, the Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a new high on October 3rd. The S&P 500 is still about 10% below its peak while the Nasdaq composite remains more than 50% below its all time high – both set in March 2000.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-july-2006/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2006</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">Warfare has broken out in the Middle East. The U.N. has passed a resolution on North Korea, but that government has stated that they will ignore it.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletter-april-2006/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2006</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As your asset class performance reports shows, the past twelve months have been very strong. The international equities have done particularly well, as have the U.S. small stocks.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletters-january-2006/">Quarterly Newsletter - January 2006</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">In the financial markets 2005 was a pretty standard year. The S&P 500 was up 4.89%. The Lehman Long Bond Index did 2.43%. As your asset class performance report shows, your portfolio did substantially better.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletters-october-2005/">Quarterly Newsletter - October 2005</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As your asset class performance report shows, the markets have done well over the past twelve months.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletters-july-2005/">Quarterly Newsletter - July 2005</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As you know, our method combines two basic ideas - diversification and rebalancing. Diversification means owning many different asset classes - with the expectation that some will do better than others.</p>
        </li>

        <li style="list-style: disc;">
            <a href="http://www.pinneyandscofield.com/quarterly-newsletters-april-2005/">Quarterly Newsletter - April 2005</a>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The past ten years have been a triumph for the investment method of diversification. Diversification has produced long-term results similar to those of the large capitalization U.S. growth stocks while displaying much less volatility.</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">We have two basic subjects we would like to discuss this quarter. The first is the year 2000 or millenium bug (Y2K), and the second is the general issue of market volatility and expectations.</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">This is the first in what we expect will be a series of letters on the general topic of investing and investment methodology.

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">The events of the past few months have, in our view, lent strong support to the investment ideas we espouse. In the face of considerable volatility and stress, our clients have maintained their composure, bought at lower prices, sold at higher ones, and generally prospered from market activity that can be frightening if one is not prepared for it.</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">In keeping with our now established tradition of not sending letters with our quarterly reports, we have decided to send another. We enjoy doing this, and may actually keep it up. We welcome any feedback!</p>

            <p class="lcp_excerpt">As you are quite aware, we do not often write letters to send with our quarterly reports. We are not in the “predict the future” business, and we imagine you would get pretty tired of hearing the same old sermon quarter after quarter.</p>
